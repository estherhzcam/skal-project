        <p>
          You’re tired of those friends who always know which beer to choose
          from a 101 different options and you always end up looking at the menu
          as a donkey in a palace?
        </p>

        <p></p>
        <p>
          Well, take this quiz and at least you’ll know what type of beer suits
          you the most.

            With thousands of years to build up a history and culture, there’s a
            lot to know about beer, some of it highly technical, a lot of it
            just plain interesting.

            While many people never stray from straightforward Pale Ale — or
            perhaps an IPA — or popular Macro Lagers, the world of beer is
            actually incredibly diverse. Learn about dozens of beer styles from
            the world’s most popular beers to extremely esoteric brews.

          <p>Have fun expanding your palate. Skål!</p>
