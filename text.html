<p>INDIAN PALE ALES (I.P.A.) originated in England during the 19th century and were made extra strong and hoppy to survive the ocean journey to India. The powerful and often fruity flavours of IPAs make them a great pairing for foods that feature any combination of fat, spiciness and fruit</p>

<h2>WHEAT BEER<br>you can handle anything!
<p>You're that friend that everyone want to have around and always has some kind words to say. </p>
<p>Pale or browner...It doesn't matter. When a brewer adds wheat to the mix, it gives the beer a foamy head, a silky texture and a special kind of sweetness. In fact, some wheat beers give off a distinctive aroma of banana or bubble gum.</p>

<p>Your're in the DARK ALE team. You need some refreshment in your life but you also like some challenge, so you couldn't choose any other side rather than the DARK.</p>
<p>DARK ALES add depth to Team Lager. While they’re still comparatively light-bodied, they can have the rich aromas you’d expect from a dark beer, including chocolate, coffee, molasses and pumpernickel bread. So if you like refreshment and complexity, a dark lager can give you the best of both worlds.</p>
